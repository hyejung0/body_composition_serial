This file displays working example of joint modeling of longitudinal outcome using linear mixed effect model and survival outcome using Cox model. The longitudinal process is body composition and survival outcome is death.

We are interested in modeling the changes of body composition (longitudinal outcome) as well as the impact of the changes body composition on survival (survival outcome). To do so, we must perform joint modelling approach, rather than fitting separate survival and longitudinal models. There are two reasons for such approach. First, when performing survival modeling with time-dependent covariate, the covariate is required to be external. That is, the body composition at time point t is not affected by death at time point u, with t>u 1. However, the body composition over time does not satisfy this condition, due to the fact that they are the output of a stochastic process generated by the patient, which is directly related to the death mechanism. Therefore, in order to produce valid inferences, a model for the joint distribution of the longitudinal and survival outcomes is required instead.  The second reason is because death causes dropout in the longitudinal measurement since no longitudinal measurements are available at and after death time. We believe that this dropout is nonrandom (i.e. the probability of dropout depends on the unobserved longitudinal response), which may induce bias from an analysis that ignores the dropout process2. 

Baseline hazard function that estimate a relative risk of death based on true and unobserved value of the longitudinal outcome is left unspecified. Or we may change to accelerated failure time (AFT) model. The perks of using AFT instead Cox PH model is that the subject-specific risk at time t depends on the entire body composition history up to time t, whereas for the Cox PH model, the subject-specific risk depends only on the current value of the body composition.

We need the body composition for each time point t, where death occurs. We do not have this value, so we reconstruct the complete longitudinal history using linear mixed effect model. We modeled each body composition based on age at metastatic diagnosis, gender, smoking history, race ethnicity and longitudinal effect of age. Because the data are inherently unbalanced, the random intercept and slope were included to account for the repeated observation on the same patient in the covariance structure.
